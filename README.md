# WineProject
The objective of our project is to identify the chemical properties that are important in determining the quality of wine, and whether or not the type of wine is significant in quality determination. We used step selection for AIC, BIC and Radj2 on a multiple linear regression model, and manual backwards selection based on p-values on the multinomial logistic regression model. For both models, we also utilized cross validation with train and test subsets. We found that the multinomial model was substantially better than the linear model, but still had about 45% error. We concluded that type is indeed significant in determining the wine quality, and that the most important determinants are all but total sulfur dioxide and citric acid. We also conclude it is possible to objectively establish what good wine is.
